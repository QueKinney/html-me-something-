        <div><p>My family is my motivation and my support system.They have pushed me to excel in school, and as a result I will be the first of my immediate family to graduate from a university.  I will be graduating with a Bachelor Degree of Science in Business Technology.When I first switched my major from accounting to Business Technology it was just an adjustment to be more successful academically.After my first year of taking courses in my new major I fell in love.Over the years my passion for creativity has grown.That is when I decided to go the route to pursuing Interactive Digital Media.Every day I wake up with the mindset that everything happens for a reason and anything is possible. Prior to graduation my hope and dream position will allow me to use my education, training,and creativity building web pages. Everything I have been through has made me a stronger woman and I am determined to get everything in life that God has destined for me.</p>
